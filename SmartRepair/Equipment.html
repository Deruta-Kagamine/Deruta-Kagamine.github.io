                <p>Injuries can be very severe and surface level view of injuries may not be enough. This is why SmartRepair Agents are not only set of with general emergency kits,
                    but also an immobilizer for potential neck injuries. Its been shown that neck injuries that're openly adjusted in incorrect positions can lead to lifelong nerve
                    damage, which is synonymous to loss of motor functions. To best prevent that, injured parties may be placed in an immobilizer to drive down the chances of spine/neck
                    injuries with this tool. Click on the button below to learn more...

                <hr>
                <p>Not all problems happen in the light of day, and not all will occur in the small light that we shine. To push around this obstacle, the State Assistance (Insurance)
                    Program has formally issued a grant, authorizing SmartRepair Agents to be equiped with Night Vision Goggles (NVG's). Allowing Agents to see much farther past the
                    darkness that not even our trucks and vans can shine light on. These can also be very useful for ensuring that the surroundings are safe, and injuried parties left
                    in the dark, aren't missed. Click on the button below to learn more...
