            <h2>Tsunami Cleanup Crew</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The TCC is a sub-unit to the SmartRepair team, and utilized only in specific scenarios when complete collapse of buildings, road paths, and general envirnomental destruction
                is registered within the state. During this event, and emergency order is placed down for citizens, so movement in the outside area is <strong>highly discouraged</strong>.
                During this time, the Tsunami Cleanup Crew (TCC) will move along the areas affected and begin fixing the area as if nothing swept it away. The TCC does keep a very specific chart
                with entities that existed within the provided area, if the item was not originally there, contact your local SmartRepair team for SAP processing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Around this time, the TCC will review areas that're affected and revitalize the area, it is also not recommended to touch, interact, or otherwise converse with any TCC Agent
                while maintenance is being performed. These Agents are stationed with a high-level threat protection order, and will not hesitate to retaliate if anything is bound to threaten them.
                <strong style="color: red;">If you were caught in a recent Tsunami, and do see a TCC Agent, you may call out to them for medical attention</strong> as each team dispatched is covered with a highly knowledgeable, medical personnel.</p>
