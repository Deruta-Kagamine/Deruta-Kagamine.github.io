            <h2>SmartRepair Contractors</h2>
            <p>SmartRepair is an on the job, work hard and get it done, environment with hosting on commission based pay dependant on the amount of tasks performed.
                These hardworking individuals seek out towns, open roads, and large infrastructured zones to find anything in disrepair. Continuously scouring the State to complete
                any work orders, or any unreported damages found to both Government and Civilian class assets. </p>
            <p>If you'd like to join your local SmartRepair team, go ahead into a local city/town to find a Job Center, which is identified by a briefcase on your smartphone mapping application. 
                Once inside, you'll want to request the position of City Repair Worker. Afterwards, you'll be able to head out to the repair shop and grab your gear to start repairing your State.</p>

            <h2>Affiliated* Agencies</h2>

            <p>As SmartRepair is not an Out of Pocket vendor for repairs and resources, multiple United States and some Foreign Agencies have teamed up with SmartRepair to generate
                a Government Funded restoration program under the U.S. Department of Infrastructure. Leading the charge for quick repairs to your local lands without having to fork
                the bill, as some repairs may be of minimal costs, but some others may require large sums that both Tax Payers, and local Officials, may not be able to upkeep in time.
                Provided that these services are available to your State, the local teams will automatically scour random locations, or move to work orders to repair any damaged assets.
                Once they've provided assistance to that location, you'll be able to see that you will not be contacted, or invoiced, for payment.</p>
